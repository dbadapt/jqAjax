jqAjax
======

This is the jQuery AJAX functions only.  Extracted from jQuery 1.8.3.   It is designed for REST SDK developers that want to use the jQuery AJAX interface without conflicting with jQuery versions and plug-ins that may already be in use by their users.  

Naruto Shippuden posted a [entry on his blog](http://noypi-linux.blogspot.com/2013/05/build-jquery-with-ajax-only.html) discussing this technique.  Itcompiles down much smaller than the new jQuery custom build with ajax only (37k smaller).  It contains good support for older browsers and a good implementation of the newer features such as the AJAX promise interface.
